Things to improve once I finish the main tutorial

- I want to have several formations, and each of them should have different enemies.
- Colors of enemies based on current score, and toughness of enemies
- Prefabs of different formations that also change depending to the score (Tier system)
- System to deliver meteors, powerups and pieces
	- instanciating them over the top edge the giving them some -y speed
	- Colliders to check whether the player got the powerups or the pieces and damage of the meteor
- Move the player shooting system to a script gun
	- Use prefabs of different guns
	- They will instantiate the lasers
	- Different gun configurations through research?
- Shield
	- Creates another object inside of the ship
	- This object takes damage until it is destroyed
	- It requires a cooldown which can be reduced by powerups?
- Firing rate powerup
- Player can choose different ships

-IMPORTANT! --- Make sure we use the 'pool' pattern where instead of destroying the enemies
when killing them, we just hide them and get them ready to be used again when spawning new 
enemies (change spawn function to check whether we have non-active enemies, if we don't then
we instantiate new ones, if we do, we 'rewind' those). Hide function and a trigger to get 
back to the spawning state.
